# TiPortfolio
A portfolio management tool with built-in portfolio optimization algorithms, with extensibility for different use cases for both institutes and retail traders.

This project is heavily inspired by these projects:

- [PyBroker](https://www.pybroker.com/en/latest/index.html) / [TiBacktester](https://pypi.org/project/tibacktester/) An easy to use backtest library.
- [Riskfolio-Lib](https://riskfolio-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) A library for making quantitative strategic asset allocation.

TiPortfolio is trying to be a portfolio optimisation library, it can backtest as easy as PyBroker,
and it can be extended to different algorithms similar to Riskfolio-Lib. In another word, it is a more practical version of Riskfolio-Lib with backtesting support.



> This project is built and tested with Python 3.12, however, it should be compatible with Python 3.10 and above.
